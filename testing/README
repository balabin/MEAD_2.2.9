This directory implements a few simple tests for MEAD.  These
are called "short" because they are by no means comprehensive,
but they are pretty quick.

Running "make check" runs the tests and diffs the results against
files in subdir "expect".  The diffs should be only in file names and
least significant one or two digits of floats.  The "expect" files
were generated on i686 running Linux 2.2 and compiling MEAD [VERSION]
with gcc-2.95.2.  The numbers are consistent with results produced by
MEAD-0.2.3.  [Is this still true?]


At the moment the following tests are here:

* Solvate is run for a sphere of radius 2.0 and and unit charnge and
epsin values of both 1.0 and 4.0.  (The analytic value is -81.923 for
any epsin)

* Solinprot is run for a "molecule" consisting of a single charge in a 2
Angstrom sphere of eps=1 and a "protein" that has a 5 A radius and a
charge of -1 located 4 A from the origin and eps=4.  (The analytical
result is -75.08.)

* Multiflex is run for Glu7 of lysozyme, single conformation.
