This directory has data files for use with solvate (or selfenergy) to
calculate the Born solvation energy of a monovalent monatomic ion with
a two Angstrom radius.  This problem can also be solved analytically
using the Born formula:

  Delta G Born = -331.8 * 1 / (2*2) * (1 - 1/80) = -81.9 kcal/mole

To use the solvate program to calculate this type,

  ../solvate -epsin 1.0 born

I get -82.37 kcal/mole.  Better accuracy can be obtained by
adding a finer grid level in the sphere.ogm file.
